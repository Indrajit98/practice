            <h1 class="sm:text-3xl text-xl sm:py-5 font-semibold px-3"><span>1. </span> Difference Between Local
                Storage, Session Storage </h1>
            <p class="leading-7 sm:text-xl py-5 px-3"><strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property
                provides access to the Document’s local
                storage object,
                the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage
                data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the
                last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing
                or incognito session).

                DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per character.
                Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. The data stored in
                LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded over HTTP (e.g.,
                http://example.com), localStorage returns a different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS (e.g.,
                https://abc.com).

                If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of
                being loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different
                browsers. Each file appears to be returned a different object by localStorage in all current browsers:
                URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each URL: file having its own unique local storage area.

                This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain
                unclear. As such, there’s a possibility that browsers may change how they handle files at any time. The
                way some browsers handle it has evolved. </p>
            <p class="leading-7 sm:text-xl px-3">
                <strong>Session Storage</strong> objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property.
                The difference
                between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid
                for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is
                open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab
                or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the
                same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original
                tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage
                objects.

                A page’s protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by scripts
                accessed through HTTP (for example, http://abc.com) is stored in a separate object from the same site
                accessed through HTTPS (for instance, https://abc.com). A DOMString number is two bytes per character in
                UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for
                objects.

                scope</h1>
            <p class="leading-7 sm:text-xl px-3"> In contrast to global variables, locally scoped ones are only visible
                within the function they are
                declared. Each function written in JavaScript creates a new local scope and every variable declared in
                this scope is a local variable. That means that variables with the same name can be used in different
                functions. However, any effort to reference a local variable outside its scope will result in a
                Reference Error:</p>
            <p class="leading-7 sm:text-xl px-3">A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared
                outside all functions or curly
                braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in
                the program, including inside blocks.</p>

            <h1 class="sm:text-3xl py-5 px-3 font-semibold"><span>3. </span>How does JS event loop work?</h1>
            <p class="leading-7 sm:text-xl px-3">The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

            <h1 class="sm:text-3xl py-5 px-3 font-semibold"><span>4. </span>Undefined Error</h1>
            <p class="leading-7 sm:text-xl px-3">
                undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial
                value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

                In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is
                not the case, avoid overriding it.)

                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
                undefined if a value was not returned.
